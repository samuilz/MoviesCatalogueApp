# Problem
*In these days everybody watch movies. But before we start watching a movie we have to choose it. That's why we made this application 
to help our users to choose their movies properly. We give an opportunity to our users to see all of our movies and if they want they can see them by different genres. Furthermore users can add movie to catalogue and the application has home page with latest movies.*
